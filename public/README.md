# Computer-Science-Project
This is my A-level computer science project.
My project is a nutruition website that allows the user to create an account and on that account there will be curated meals for them based off the food they have in the house (which they input) and their desired cuisines. Another thing I intend to add to the webstie is to graph the users macro intake which then can give more recommendations of what the user should eat for a healthy diet
